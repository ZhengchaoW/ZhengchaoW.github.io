    coauthors: Samantha Chen, Sunhyuk Lim, Facundo Mémoli, Yusu Wang
    publishedat: "To appear in ICML workshop: Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Machine Learning (2023)"
    description: We present a novel interpretation of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) distance, using concepts from stochastic processes, and discuss the implications for understanding the Lipschitz property and the universal approximation results for graph neural networks.
  - title: "The Persistent Laplacian for Data Science: Evaluating Higher-Order Persistent Spectral Representations of Data"
    link: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/davies23c/davies23c.pdf
    coauthors: Thomas Davies, Ruben Sanchez-Garcia
    publishedat: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)
    description: We introduce the persistent Laplacian as a feature vector that encodes persistent homology and additional geometric information, and demonstrate its usefulness in data analysis.
  - title: "Understanding Oversquashing in GNNs through the Lens of Effective Resistance"
    link: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/black23a/black23a.pdf
    coauthors: Mitchell Black, Amir Nayyeri, Yusu Wang
    publishedat: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)
    description: We propose to use effective resistance as a way to quantify oversquashing in graph neural networks and study how this can be used to modify input graphs to alleviate the oversquashing problem.
  - title: "The Numerical Stability of Hyperbolic Representation Learning"

    coauthors: Gal Mishne, Yusu Wang, Sheng Yang
    publishedat: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)
    description: We analyze the limitations of two popular hyperbolic learning models, the Poincaré ball and Lorentz model, and provide insights on how to overcome numerical instability issues.
  - title: "A generalization of the persistent Laplacian to simplicial maps"

    publishedat: 39th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2023)
    description: A novel generalization of the framework of the persistent Laplacian to the setting of filtrations of simplicial complexes related via simplicial maps
  - title: "Weisfeiler-Lehman meets Gromov-Wasserstein"

    coauthors: Samantha Chen, Sunhyuk Lim, Facundo Mémoli, Yusu Wang
    publishedat: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2022)
    description: We introduce a distance between Markov chains based on the classic Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. This distance can be used to analyze GNNs.
